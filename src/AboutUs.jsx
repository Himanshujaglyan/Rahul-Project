                Deepfakes are going to be the first real punch from AI to humanity. 
                The cybersecurity industry has a very short time to get ahead of deepfakes 
                before they undermine the publicâ€™s trust in reality.

                We first recognized the danger while our parent company <strong> Zemana </strong> 
                researched methods to develop an AI-based antivirus engine. Later, in mid-2018, 
                we started our research on deepfake detection and generation as the deepware AI team.
